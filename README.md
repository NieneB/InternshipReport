# Internship Report

From March until July 2015 I am working on an intership project at the Waag Society, Amsterdam.
This is the report that will be the outcome of the project.

Install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Prince](http://www.princexml.com/), then open two terminal windows. In one, run:
