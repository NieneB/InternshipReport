The focus will be on the visual information communication. To turn raw data sets into understandable knowledge on the explanatory level with a user-centered design. The main focus is on the communication for creating knowledge.

They will be elaborated on to specify why the application makes use of Leaflet. 




<!-- ### Visualization of field-names
### User requirements

The target group must feel:

- U1 Attracted to use the application
- U2 Attracted to stay and play around with the application
- U3 Challenged to explore more
- U4 Discover the meaning of the field-names in relation to their environment
- U5 Discover interesting stories and surprising facts about the field-names
- U6 Understand the field-names and their value

### Functional requirements

- F1 The application must be intuitive and simple to use, so it shows quick and surprising results on the actions of the target group.
- F2 The application must be technically working in an efficient and error-safe way. User friendly.

### Context requirements
There are no context requirements for this study.





#### Fieldnames preprocessing
All the data was delivered separate .DAT files and scattered over several folders and sources. 
n order to work with the files in Qgis all the files needed to be converted to shape-files. This was done in R.  In Qgis, manually the attribute names needed were changed in one standardized name in order to merge all the data together.

Because this resulted into a lot of overlapping areas, instead, the field-names were all linked to the Kadaster dataset from 1830. So a single layer of polygons with multiple names is the result. This was done by spatially joining the datasets, or joining by the Kadaster ID’s which most of the datasets contained. The ID contained; municipality, sheet map number, parcel number. 

Eventually, the field-names that had no category assigned had to be classified as well. The cadastre field-names and .. were not included in the previous research by the RCE, but were added here, to have more coverage and amount of field-names.

The classification was done in R. See <a class="xref" href=#"> appendix $$ </a> for the script.  A field-name can consist out of multiple words with a different meaning and multiple categories and lemmings can be assigned to one field name.  The classification provided by the RCE was used. This contained per category, different codes and alternative words that signifies the same. 

The script  runs through all the field-names and all the possible categories, to match which category was applicable.

 While reading few of the names, new ideas for a category came up and added. The category wind direction W.
 
####AHN
The AHN2 tiles covering the research area were downloaded from nationaalgeoregister.nl to show the relation of the field-names with the environment. The AHN has proved useful for historical research. Small differences in the landscape can be seen in the AHN2 and already historians and archeologist use it to discover old settlements that cant be discovered with the naked eye. (Actueel Hoogtebestand Nederland, n.d.)

The raster data has a resolution of 5 meters and a precision of systematic and stochastic error of max 5 cm the projection is RD new ( EPSG28992). (Actueel Hoogtebestand Nederland, n.d.) 

The maximum and minimum values of the total area are 29.5 and -1.9 meters respectively.

See <a class ="xref" href="#"> appendix </a>  for table with all the tiles used.   

The AHN is measured with laser altimetry or LIDAR. Laser beams shot from an airplane and localized with GPS. It is measured over several time periods and merged in the end to get a detailed measurement of the height. The eventual end product delivered is corrected to ground level.(maaiveld) So vegetation, buildings and other object do not appear. (Actueel Hoogtebestand Nederland, n.d.) These filtered areas are given no-data values. 

For use in the application, the transect line looks best when not containing any gaps. Therefore, the no-data values are filled by the fill no-data tool of Qgis. This takes an average of around 100 pixels to calculate the average height of the missing pixels. 

#### Kadaster parcels 1830
Data from the cadastre were also supplied by the RCE, showing the plots and parcels as they were in 1830. And can be used to refer the fieldnames to. The dataset is in projection RDnew(EPSG28992).
No preprocessing needed other then explained in <a class="xref" href="#" > section $$ </a> preprocessing field-names.

####Water bodies
The water bodies are downloaded from the open data PDOK.nl. The Top10NLactueel contains all topology of the Netherlands on a scale of 1:25.000.
From this dataset only the water polygons are used and clipped to the research area. So the names of the water bodies can be included into the application. (“TOP10NL | Publieke Dienstverlening Op de Kaart Loket,” n.d.)
EPSG28992

Only processing was clipped to the research area. No other preprocessing needed other then was used for the AHN.
