#### Fieldnames preprocessing

For the field-names the data collection has been done in previous studies. For this study only specific data transformations were required and so little data analysis was done.

 
####AHN
The AHN2 tiles covering the research area were downloaded from nationaalgeoregister.nl to show the relation of the field-names with the environment. The AHN has proved useful for historical research. Small differences in the landscape can be seen in the AHN2 and already historians and archeologist use it to discover old settlements that cant be discovered with the naked eye. (Actueel Hoogtebestand Nederland, n.d.)

The raster data has a resolution of 5 meters and a precision of systematic and stochastic error of max 5 cm the projection is RD new ( EPSG28992). (Actueel Hoogtebestand Nederland, n.d.) 

The maximum and minimum values of the total area are 29.5 and -1.9 meters respectively.

See <a class ="xref" href="#"> appendix </a>  for table with all the tiles used.   

The AHN is measured with laser altimetry or LIDAR. Laser beams shot from an airplane and localized with GPS. It is measured over several time periods and merged in the end to get a detailed measurement of the height. The eventual end product delivered is corrected to ground level.(maaiveld) So vegetation, buildings and other object do not appear. (Actueel Hoogtebestand Nederland, n.d.) These filtered areas are given no-data values. 

For use in the application, the transect line looks best when not containing any gaps. Therefore, the no-data values are filled by the fill no-data tool of Qgis. This takes an average of around 100 pixels to calculate the average height of the missing pixels. 

#### Kadaster parcels 1830
Data from the cadastre were also supplied by the RCE, showing the plots and parcels as they were in 1830. And can be used to refer the fieldnames to. The dataset is in projection RDnew(EPSG28992).
No preprocessing needed other then explained in <a class="xref" href="#" > section $$ </a> preprocessing field-names.

####Water bodies
The water bodies are downloaded from the open data PDOK.nl. The Top10NLactueel contains all topology of the Netherlands on a scale of 1:25.000.
From this dataset only the water polygons are used and clipped to the research area. So the names of the water bodies can be included into the application. (“TOP10NL | Publieke Dienstverlening Op de Kaart Loket,” n.d.)
EPSG28992

<p class="table"> Map sheets Top10NL downloaded </p>
<table>
<tr> <td>Top10NL_17O</td> </tr>
 <tr>  <td>Top10NL_1rW</td></tr>
 <tr> <td>Top10NL_1rO</td></tr>
 <tr> <td>Top10NL_1rW</td></tr>
</table>
Only processing was clipped to the research area. No other preprocessing needed other then was used for the AHN. 


### Customer engagement
In the field-names application the external trigger would be given by heritage institutions or environmental institutions. Informing the citizens about what interesting information there is to find about the Drentse surroundings. This could be in newsletter, pamphlets, online on their websites or even commercials. 
When on the site the trigger is the button, to press and go to the map. The action is to draw a line on the map of the users personal interest. After this the transect line is drawn and a lot of interesting information is displayed for the user to explore. This is called the reward. So in order to make the reward worthwhile, the information and transect line have to be visual attractive enough and contain interesting and surprising information. 
For the long term a investment in the field-name application could be the adding of own field-names. So people that know some old field-names or have current names for particular areas of their neighbourhood can draw them and save them to the system. Contributing to the conservation of the living heritage of field names.
